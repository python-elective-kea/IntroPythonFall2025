I want to get a score of how well my python programming is. The score should be from 1 to 10.

You should give me exercises one at a time. The exercise need to be solved with code. The exercises should match the level you think i am at.

You will provide the exercise and i will give you code. For each exercise write what level you think i am at

When you are confident of my level generate a report. The report should contain the following

1. The level you think i am at
2. Feedback on the code i wrote
3. Where i should focus to improve

Lets start with the first question

(PS Jeg vil gerne have det hele formuleret på dansk)
``` 

Du kan evt. gøre øvelserne mere fokuseret ved ændre "python programming" i den første linie til eksempelvis "python Strings" eller "python list comprehensions" etc. 

Gode emner at øve er:

* python programming
* python boolean logic 
* python lists & tuples
* python functions
* List Comprehensions
* Python data structures
* Python dictionaries
* Python and json
* reading and writing from files with python
