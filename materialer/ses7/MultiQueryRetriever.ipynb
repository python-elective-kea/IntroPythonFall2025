    "# How to use the MultiQueryRetriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance-based [vector database](/docs/concepts/vectorstores/) retrieval [embeds](/docs/concepts/embedding_models/) (represents) queries in high-dimensional space and finds similar embedded documents based on a distance metric. But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording, or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MultiQueryRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/retrievers/langchain.retrievers.multi_query.MultiQueryRetriever.html) automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` can mitigate some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.\n",
